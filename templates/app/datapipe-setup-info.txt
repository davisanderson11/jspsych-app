};
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Data Not Appearing
- Check console.log for errors
- Verify your experiment ID is correct

### CORS Errors
- DataPipe should handle CORS, but if issues arise, ensure you're using HTTPS
- Contact DataPipe support if problems persist

### Failed Submissions
- Check `www/js/datapipe-config.js` has correct experiment ID
- Look in app data directory for `failed_submission_*.json` files
- These will retry automatically on next app launch with internet
